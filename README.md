# TimeTracker App – Landing Page (Public Project)

**Note:** This is a portfolio landing page developed for Epoca. No confidential code or data is shared in this repository.

## 🧭 Project Overview

This landing page supports the marketing and onboarding funnel of the TimeTracker App platform. Built using the latest features of **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, the site emphasizes responsiveness, animation, and developer performance. The design was fully aligned with approved Figma mockups.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

I led the frontend development of this standalone landing page. Responsibilities included:

- Setting up the **Next.js 14 App Router** project from scratch
- Implementing all UI components in alignment with Figma designs
- Proposing and implementing **fully responsive layouts**, as mobile views were not included in the original design
- Adding **scroll-triggered animations** using `framer-motion`
- Building **custom layout logic** and positioning for decorative stickers
- Ensuring **accessibility, responsiveness**, and cross-browser compatibility
- Managing assets, fonts, and metadata for **SEO and performance**

Additionally, I configured **CI/CD** using GitLab pipelines to deploy Docker images to AWS ECR with OIDC authentication.
